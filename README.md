# Data-science.
This refference, and the code guide me become a data scientist that i have learned about what does the data scientist do.
I have learned several projects, such as:
1. Classification
2. Regression (i love much of this projects because i love calculus)
3. Forecasting (this project similar with regression)
4. Clustering
5. Scrapping
5. EDA (this task is usually done by data analys or business intelligence)
6. ETL (this task is usually done by data engineer)

I also learning by doing that i have used some packages for projects or practices, such as:
1. pandas (this package is main using for dataframe)
2. numpy
3. matplotlib (this package for visualization the dataset, it make easier to analyze the data)
4. scipy (this package is using for statisthical purpose)
5. scikit-learn (this package is main using for machine learning)
6. fbprophet (this package is using for forecasting)
7. requests, urllib, selenium (this package are using for scrapping data from website)
8. re (this package is using for regex expression)


# You have to click the 'Project.ipynb' above to watch the main portofolio i created.
There are several projects and practices that you have to see them.
1. Click data-science-practice for practice subject, this folder contain jupyter notebook codes
2. Click project-ds for project subject that i documented in pdf or the code can access in data-science-practice
3. Click Dataset for dataset subject that i used for practice and project
4. Click Certificate-training-completion for certificate i have done some courses
