# Data-enthusiast.
This refference, and the code guide me become a data enthusiast that i have learned about what does the data enthusiast do,
such as data engineering, data analyst, data scientist, or business intelligence.

I have learned several projects, such as:
1. Classification
2. Regression (i love much of this projects because i love calculus)
3. Forecasting (this project similar with regression)
4. Clustering
5. Scrapping
5. EDA (this task is usually done by data analys or business intelligence)
6. ETL (this task is usually done by data engineer)

I also learning by doing that i have used some packages for projects or practices, such as:
1. pandas, (this package is main using for dataframe)
2. numpy,
3. matplotlib, (this package for visualization the dataset, it make easier to analyze the data)
4. scipy, (this package is using for statisthical purpose)
5. scikit-learn, (this package is main using for machine learning)
6. fbprophet, (this package is using for forecasting)
7. requests, urllib, selenium (this package are using for scrapping data from website)
8. BeautifulSoup, (this package using for parsing html schema)
9. re (this package is using for regex expression)
10. Datetime, (this package using for time-series dataset)

And also iam able to operate some programing languages.
1. Python, (i love this interpreter language)
2. C++,  (i love this compiler language)
3. Java, (for OOP)
4. Matlab/Octave, (i used to scientific purpose)
5. Gnuplot, (visualitazion as scientific format especially in graph 2dimension)
6. R, (another tools data processing instead of python)
7. LAMMPS, (molecular dynamics program for artificial simulation dynamics in scientific purpose)
8. Pentaho, (ETL software for Data Engineer)
9. SQL, (certainly i use MySQL and PostgreSQL for data analysis)
10. Ms. Office, (Ms. Word, Ms. Excel, Ms. PPT)
11. Linux, (several syntaxes)


# You have to click the 'Portofolio_Current_exchange_IDR_USD.ipynb' above to watch the main portofolio i created.
There are several projects and practices that you have to see them.
1. Click data-science-practice for practice and the portfolio subject, this folder contain jupyter notebook and SQL codes
2. Click project-ds for project subject that i documented in pdfs or the code can access in data-science-practice
3. Click Dataset for dataset subject that i used for practice and project
4. Click Certificate-training-completion for certificate i have done some courses
